# jhu_dap_470.768_final
An analysis of the SCDB issue level dataset for my final project in Johns Hopkins' Programming and Data Management class.

In this repo, you will find the following documents:
1. references.bib = A file that accesses the reference to the SCDB. While I do disclose my own blog posts in a footnote, I do not use that previous work in this, so I do not formally cite it.
2. apa.csl.txt = a file to automatically create citations in APA style.
3. scotus_data_cleaning.R = A file that has all my code I used for data cleaning and analysis. The analysis pieces are also present in hegedus_final_project_470.768.qmd.
4. hegedus_final_project_470.768.qmd = the text file with all the code showing.
5. hegedus_final_project_470.768.html = the html version without the code, just the outputs
6. hegedus_final_project_470.768.pdf = the pdf version without the code, just the outputs
